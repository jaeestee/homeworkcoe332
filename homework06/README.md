# The Data in the Genes
This homework contains the script ``gene_api.py``. This script is a flask and redis application that is used to return data from the Human Genome Organization (HUGO). The data returned is explained in the sections below.

***gene_api.py***
- This flask app contains functions that are called when queries are sent to the running app, therefore returning values that were requested. The functions are:
  - ``delete_data()``, ``post_data()``, ``data()``, ``gene_ids()``, and ``specific_gene_data()``.
> The functions correspond to the queries in the "Queries To Use" section, respectively.

# Image Handling
## Pulling the image ```jaeestee/gene_api``` from Docker Hub:
To pull the existing image, run this command:
```bash
$ docker pull jaeestee/gene_api
```
If done properly, ``jaeestee/gene_api`` should show up with the tag ``latest`` when running this command:
```bash
$ docker images
```
> The output should look similar to this:
> ```
> REPOSITORY             TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
> jaeestee/gene_api      latest    d8376d24fa21   1 hours ago     887MB
> ```

> Back up to [Navigation](https://github.com/jaeestee/homeworkcoe332/blob/main/homework06/README.md#navigation)
## Running the image:
To start running the containerized Flask app, run this command:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
> Remember that the docker-compose.yml file must exist in the same folder for this to work!
If done properly, the output should look similar to this:
```
Creating network "homework06_default" with the default driver
Creating homework06_redis-db_1 ... done
Creating homework06_flask-app_1 ... done
```
Now the app is running!
> **IMPORTANT: This does not have to be running on a separate tab since it is running in the background using the ``-d`` command!!!**

To check that the application is running, run this command:
```bash
$ docker ps
```
If the application is running properly, the output should look similar to this:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS        PORTS                                       NAMES
8a314bf73084   jaeestee/gene_api   "python gene_api.py"     2 seconds ago   Up 1 second   0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp, :::5000->5000/tcp   homework06_flask-app_1
de1d39e3cab4   redis:7             "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   2 seconds ago   Up 1 second   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp, :::6379->6379/tcp   homework06_redis-db_1
```
> If not, the output should look similar to this:
> ```
> CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS        PORTS                                       NAMES
> ```

To stop the application from running in the background, run this command:
```bash
$ docker-compose down
```
If done properly, the output should look similar to this:
```
Stopping homework06_flask-app_1 ... done
Stopping homework06_redis-db_1  ... done
Removing homework06_flask-app_1 ... done
Removing homework06_redis-db_1  ... done
Removing network homework06_default
```

## Building a New Image:
To build a new image from the **Dockerfile** present in this directory, run this command:
```
$ docker build -t <dockerhubusername>/iss_tracker:<version> .
```
> **IMPORTANT: Make sure to be in the same directory as the ``Dockerfile`` and DO NOT FORGET THE "." at the very end of this command!!!**

If done properly, the output should look similar to this:
```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  19.46kB
Step 1/6 : FROM python:3.8.10
 ---> a369814a9797
Step 2/6 : RUN pip install Flask==2.2.2

Now you have successfully created your own image!

# Queries To Use:
## To load the data, run this command:
```bash
$ curl localhost:5000/data -X POST
```
If done properly, the output should look like this:
```
Successfully reloaded the dictionary with the data from the web!
```

> Back up to [Navigation](https://github.com/jaeestee/homeworkcoe332/blob/main/homework06/README.md#navigation)
## To delete the data, run this command:
```bash
$ curl localhost:5000/data -X DELETE
```
If done properly, the output should look like this:
```
Successfully deleted all the data from the dictionary!
```

> Back up to [Navigation](https://github.com/jaeestee/homeworkcoe332/blob/main/homework06/README.md#navigation)
## To print the entire data set (whether it exists or not), run this command:
```bash
$ curl localhost:5000/data
```
> This will send a get request using curl to the app that should be running.

If done properly, the end of the output should look similar to one of these 3 outputs:
- Output possibility 1:
```
    ],
    "numFound": 43625,
    "start": 0
  },
  "responseHeader": {
    "QTime": 26,
    "status": 0
  }
}
```
> This will print out the entire data set, but as long as you see something similar to this last section, it printed everything properly.

- Output possibility 2:
```
The data does not exist...
```
> This means that the POST method has not been called or that the DELETE method was called.

> Back up to [Navigation](https://github.com/jaeestee/homeworkcoe332/blob/main/homework06/README.md#navigation)
## To print out a list of all gene IDs in the data set, run this command:
```bash
$ curl localhost:5000/genes
```
If done properly, the end of the output should look similar to this:
```
  "HGNC:25468",
  "HGNC:13195",
  "HGNC:13198",
  "HGNC:13199",
  "HGNC:28160",

  "HGNC:13200",
  "HGNC:51695",
  "HGNC:29027",
  "HGNC:24523"
]
```
> An error message will appear if the data is empty or doesn't exist yet. Additionally, there should be a lot more data points, this is just a shortened version.

> Back up to [Navigation](https://github.com/jaeestee/homeworkcoe332/blob/main/homework06/README.md#navigation)
## To print specific data on a gene, run this command:
```bash
$ curl localhost:5000/genes/<geneID>
```
> Make sure to replace the geneID with a specific gene ID as shown below:
> ```bash
> $ curl localhost:5000/genes/HGNC:24523
> ```
If done properly, the output should look similar to this:
```

# Describing the Gene Data:
This gene data was provided by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. This committee is a part of the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) and oversees the approval of every gene name. Therefore, HGNC assigns every gene an HGNC ID, a gene symbol, an approved name, and many more (for more details, check out the website below).
> From the [HGNC Complete Set Archive](https://www.genenames.org/download/archive/)

In this application, the data was pulled from this specific url, [Current JSON format hgnc_complete_set file](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/genenames/hgnc/json/hgnc_complete_set.json), which is located at the very bottom of their website.
